# myconfig

This repo primarily contains configurations that I like to use for editors(like vim), file managers(krusader under linux, total commander under windows), bashrc configuration, etc ...

### vim

My favourite _vimrc configuration. I would just download the file, copy it under the HOME directory in windows and also under Linux and restart vim. The plugins, however still need to be installed manually.
