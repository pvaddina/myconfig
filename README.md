# myconfig

This repo primarily contains configurations that I like to use for editors(like vim), file managers(krusader under linux, total commander under windows), bashrc configuration, etc ...

### vim

My favourite vimrc configuration. I love to just download this on the respective platform and use it. However the plugins still need to be installed manually.
